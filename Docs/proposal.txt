Project Proposal

Team Member: James Vu

Overview: I am going to be developing a Discord Bot application called Windia. I will be using JavaScript to write it. The bot’s function is to read commands from a Discord server and output information depending on the user’s input.

Goal: Deploying the Discord bot and having it run functions that can search for information and cleaning up messages

Resources: Uses discord.js which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, node.js is JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and npm software which is a package manager for JavaScript

Usage: discord.js is mainly used to connect to the Discord server, node.js to run the software, and npm to install dependencies
