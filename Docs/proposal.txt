Project Proposal

Team Member: James Vu

Overview: I am going to be developing a Discord Bot application called Windia. I will be using JavaScript to write it. The bot’s function is to read commands from a Discord server and output information depending on the user’s input.

Goal: Deploying the Discord bot and having it run functions that can search for information and cleaning up messages

Resources: Uses discord.io which is licensed under the MIT License, winston which is licensed under MIT License, dotenv which is licensed under the BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License, and npm software which is a package manager for JavaScript

Usage: discord.io is mainly used to connect to the Discord server, winston is a logger, dotenv is used for environment variables when I use sensitive information like the token key
